# Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model with Multi-Scenario Analysis

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive Leveraged Buyout (LBO) model with advanced features, including multi-scenario analysis, sensitivity testing, and detailed visualization of financial outcomes. It is designed for financial professionals and analysts to evaluate the feasibility and profitability of LBO transactions.

## Features
- **Core LBO Modeling**: Calculates key metrics such as Equity IRR, Debt Repayment Schedules, and Enterprise Value.
- **Multi-Scenario Analysis**: Evaluate different financial scenarios (Base, Optimistic, Pessimistic, etc.) to assess sensitivity to key assumptions.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate charts such as Equity Curve, Drawdown Analysis, and Scenario Comparison.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for running demos and performing detailed analysis.
- **Configurable Assumptions**: Easily adjust model inputs (e.g., Exit Multiples, Growth Rates, and Debt Structure) via a configuration file.
- **Docker Support**: Run the application in a pre-configured container for a consistent environment.


```
